One of my good friends told me about this most excellent Club Nintendo [deal][pokelink] currently going on right now. Essentially you have to register your 3DS (or 2DS) and a game (out of a specific set), and you get a digital copy of Pokemon X or Y for free!

It's a crazy good deal, but there are a couple of things to keep in mind:

- The 3DS/2DS cannot have already been registered to your (or anyone's) account

- The games you can register in order to get the deal are:

	- Mario Kart 7

	- Super Mario 3D Land

	- Animal Crossing: New Leaf

	- Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D

	- LEGO City Undercover: The Chase Begins

	- Yoshi's New Island

- If you already got a digital copy of one of these games *BEFORE* you registered on Club Nintendo, then that game cannot be used in this promo

- If you are buying a digital copy of a game *AFTER* joining Club Nintendo, in order to register it, you need to link your 3DS to your Club Nintendo account (and no, linking your 3DS will not register it with Club Nintendo automatically for you), which can be done via the eShop's settings on your 3DS

Since I got the Animal Crossing 3DS bundle back in June, I couldn't register my digital copy of Animal Crossing: New Leaf. I was lucky that my dad had picked up a copy of Mario Kart 7 for us as a Christmas present so I registered that and got my free copy of Pokemon X yesterday. :)

And again, here's the link to the promo: [Club Nintendo Pokemon Offer][pokelink]
