As someone who has combination/oily skin (which means my skin is mostly oily in the T-zone on my face), I've got acne and related blemishes all over my face. Over the years, my nightly ritual has grown to include the application of topical acids to try and destroy the acne. Unfortunately, they smell kind of gross and feel like burning. They also leave my skin flaky and dry.

My goal now is to step away from these destructive products and find something that is a) effective, and b) doesn't destroy my skin.

The set of products that I'm trying is by [Herbivore Botanicals][herbivore]. They're a Seattle-based company that's been around for 4 years or so. Their products have a simple, but elegant aesthetic.

- [Bamboo Charcoal Cleansing Bar Soap][soap]
- [Balance Facial Toning Elixir][elixir] (discontinued)

My criteria for evaluating skincare products is focused around 3 points:

- how they make my skin feel externally (i.e. physical touch)
- how they make my skin feel internally
- how effective they are at doing what they're marketed as doing

So how do the Bamboo Charcoal and Toning Elixir stack up so far? I've been using them in conjunction for about a month now and my skin has definitely improved. In terms of the external feel, my skin feels very soft, and though the oil in my face builds up again after a few hours, it doesn't feel suffocating like it did before. From the inside, I definitely feel the described "tightening" of my pores. It's hard to explain exactly, but it conjures up the image of being squeaky clean in my mind. Although my face is still oily, the products have improved the condition of my skin while not being overly harsh about it. After using most soaps on my face, my skin there becomes rough and flaky. This is not the case with the Bamboo Charcoal soap at all.  It took a couple of washes before I got used to the smell of the products. They aren't floral or decidedly sweet, but they smell clean and kind of austere in that they smell rather no-nonsense. Another pro for the toning elixir is the fact that it's a spray bottle -- I don't need cotton balls anymore!

All in all, Herbivore Botanicals put out a good set of products. It's just a shame that they've discontinued their Balance Toning Elixir as it's a great product.
