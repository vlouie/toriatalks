I'm on day 3 of my Pokemon adventure in the Kalos region, and I have to say that I am actually loving the new features in this iteration of Pokemon. On top of the fantastic Pokemon X/Y deal mentioned in my previous post, I've come across another deal that is also on for a limited time and, quite frankly, it is LEGENDARY!

The deal this time around is for a free Celebi. Celebi is one of the legendary pokemon introduced back in Gen 2. It's a Grass/Psychic type, and last I saw, it was in the OU tier. The one you can get for free in Pokemon X/Y starts off at level 10, and it requires internet access on your 3DS/2DS as well as some free space in order to download the free Pokemon Bank app onto your system.

The process requires more than just 5 minutes of your time and I don't have screenshots of the steps, but the guide I used was from PocketGamer: [How to get your free Celebi from Pokemon Bank  on 3DS][guidelink]

The guide is easy to follow and the deal is on only until March 14, 2014.
