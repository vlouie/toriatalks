<h2>About</h2>
<div class="post">
  So you've stumbled upon my blog. Welcome, and mind the daleks!

  I generally blog about my two main interests: technology and music. These are both rather broad terms and can be extended to the realms of video games, concert reviews, and programming. Occasionally I may discuss books, writing, and any sorts of crafty projects I am working on. By having a somewhat generic blog name, I thought that I could cover all my interest bases.

  My initial reason for starting this blog was that I had acquired a Raspberry Pi. I have been a fan of web design and development for a number of years now, and nothing seemed more punk rock than turning my RPi into a web server. Blogging has been an on-again, off-again hobby for me over the years, and though I had been meaning to get back into it, no particular bloggin platform had really caught my attention. It was a natural step then to consider using my RPi web server to host a static blog. After a bit of research, I decided upon using jekyll for static generation. Because I don't want to bog down my RPi with (potentially) a number of images to accompany blog posts, I looked to AWS S3 product to host my images.

  If you would like to see my CV/resume, please direct yourself to <a href="http://victorialouie.com">victorialouie.com</a> (sadly not hosted on an RPi, but on Heroku instead).
