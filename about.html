  <h2>About</h2>
  So you've stumbled upon my blog. Welcome, and mind the daleks!
  <p>
      Sticking with the alliteration in my blog's title, I, Toria, am using this blog to talk about 3 main things: tech, tunes, and tea. These are all pretty broad terms and can be extended to the realms of video games, concert reviews, and programming. Occasionally I may discuss books, writing, and any sorts of crafty projects I am working on. Sometimes Toria will talk about things, as well, but the consonance is lost (I think).

      My initial reason for starting this blog was that I had acquired a Raspberry Pi. I have been a fan of web design and development for a number of years now, and nothing seemed more punk rock than turning my RPi into a web server. Blogging has been an on-again, off-again hobby for me over the years, and though I had been meaning to get back into it, no particular bloggin platform had really caught my attention. It was a natural step then to consider using my RPi web server to host a static blog. After a bit of research, I decided upon using jekyll for static generation. Because I don't want to bog down my RPi with (potentially) a number of images to accompany blog posts, I looked to AWS S3 product to host my images.
